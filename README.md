Reasonable Care Front End and UX

This Repository holds all of the frontend code for the reasonable care rpoject.

Reasonable Care is a web application which allows users to browse health care
plans and come to a conlusion about which plans they would like to look into
further. Users are allowed to select which of four metrics they would like to
factor in to their search (they are all on upon page load). These metrics are:
deductible vs. Premium, co-pays for primary care, co-pays for a specialist, and
co-pays for a specialist. Resulting plans are then assigned a 0-4 star score in
each of those metrics which the user has turned (or left) on.

Note: at this point, Reasonable Care is a proof of concept. There are a limited
      number of ways to filter results, and many of those even are simplified
      to, say, only apply to healthy 27 year olds who don't smoke. But the
      general ideas are all there, and I hope we've proven in creating this
      that it is possible to make something that functions to help MA residents
      choose health insurance that has a better user interface than the MA
      Health Connector.
